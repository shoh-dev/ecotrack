# EcoTrack UI/UX Design System

This document outlines the foundational elements of the EcoTrack mobile application's UI/UX design system. It serves as a guide for designers and developers to ensure consistency, usability, and a strong brand identity across the application, aligning with the MVVM architecture and Provider state management.

## 1. Design Principles

These principles guide all design decisions for EcoTrack:

* **Empowering:** Make users feel capable of understanding and reducing their environmental impact.

* **Clear & Intuitive:** Ensure ease of navigation, data input, and understanding of information, especially visualizations.

* **Encouraging & Positive:** Motivate users through positive reinforcement and celebration of progress.

* **Transparent:** Clearly explain calculations, data sources, and estimations.

* **Eco-Conscious:** Reflect environmental themes through natural colors, clean design, and mindful aesthetics.

* **Accessible:** Design for usability across a wide range of users and abilities.

## 2. Brand Identity

* **App Title:** EcoTrack

* **Tagline:** Measure Your Impact. Reduce Your Footprint. Live More Sustainably.

* **Logo Concept:** Should visually represent growth, nature, and tracking (e.g., a leaf combined with a graph or tracker icon).

## 3. Color Palette

Inspired by nature and balanced with functional UI needs. (Note: Specific hex codes are illustrative and would be finalized during design).

* **Primary:** A clean, fresh green (e.g., `#4CAF50`, `#66BB6A`). Used for primary actions, active states, key data highlights.

* **Secondary:** A calming blue (e.g., `#2196F3`, `#42A5F5`). Used for secondary actions, accents, or specific data categories (e.g., Transportation).

* **Accent:** A warm, natural tone like muted orange or brown (e.g., `#FF9800`, `#FFA726`). Used sparingly for emphasis or calls to action (e.g., "Log Activity").

* **Neutral Palette:**

  * Dark Text/Icons: `#212121` or `#424242`

  * Medium Grey (Secondary text, borders): `#757575`

  * Light Grey (Backgrounds, separators): `#E0E0E0` or `#EEEEEE`

  * White (Backgrounds, Cards): `#FFFFFF`

* **Semantic Colors:**

  * Success: Green (distinct from Primary, e.g., `#8BC34A`)

  * Warning: Orange/Amber (e.g., `#FFC107`)

  * Error: Red (e.g., `#F44336`)

  * Info: Light Blue (e.g., `#03A9F4`)

## 4. Typography

A readable sans-serif font family is recommended for clarity on mobile screens.

* **Font Family:** Roboto, Open Sans, or similar modern sans-serif.

* **Heading Styles:** Defined for screen titles, section headers (e.g., using Flutter's `TextTheme` properties like `headlineLarge`, `titleMedium`). Larger, bolder weights.

* **Body Text Styles:** For paragraphs, labels, descriptions (e.g., `bodyMedium`, `bodySmall`). Regular weights, optimized for mobile readability.

* **Data/Number Styles:** Specific styles might be considered for large numerical displays.

## 5. UI Components

Reusable components to ensure consistency (`lib/presentation/widgets`).

* **Buttons:** Primary (Filled), Secondary (Outlined), Text Button, Icon Button, Floating Action Button (FAB).

* **Input Fields:** Text Input, Dropdown, Slider, Toggle Switch, Checkbox, Radio Button, Date/Time Picker.

* **Cards/Containers:** Consistent padding, border radius, and elevation for grouping content.

* **Data Visualization Elements:** Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie/Donut Chart, Large Metric Display.

* **Navigation:** Bottom Navigation Bar, App Bar/Top Bar.

* **Indicators:** Loading Spinners, Progress Bars.

* **Feedback:** Toasts/Snackbars, Dialogs/Modals.

* **Lists:** Consistent styling for list items.

* **Icons:** A consistent set of icons for actions, categories, and navigation.

## 6. Data Visualization Principles

* **Clarity:** Easy to read and understand.

* **Context:** Always provide units (CO2e) and time periods.

* **Comparison:** Enable comparison over time or against goals.

* **Breakdown:** Clearly show category contributions.

* **Progress:** Effectively visualize goal tracking.

## 7. Layout & Spacing

* Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., multiples of 4dp or 8dp) for padding, margins, and gaps.

* Define standard screen padding.

* Ensure responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

## 8. Accessibility

* Sufficient color contrast.

* Readable font sizes, consider dynamic type.

* Clear labels for interactive elements.

* Adequate touch target sizes.

## 9. Tone of Voice

* Supportive & Encouraging

* Informative & Transparent

* Action-Oriented

* Empathetic
